# CRUD_ModelViewController

The function of the Model, View, Controller is that it allows us to separate 
the components of our application depending on the responsibility they have, 
this means that when we make a change in any part of our code, this does not 
affect another part of it. For example, if we modify our Database, we should 
only modify the model which is who is in charge of the data and the rest of 
the application should remain intact. This respects the principle of sole res-
ponsibility. 
That is, a part of your code should not know what the entire application does, 
it should only have one responsibility.

I did this example with a form registration system using CRUD (Create, Read, 
Update, and Delete), which are basic functions of databases or the persistence 
layer of all software.
